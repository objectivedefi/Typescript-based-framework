Write a short narrative about what we are going to discuss in this section and the risk we could find in this topic.

### 1.1.1 Stablecoin Classification

Write a structured risk analysis summary in paragraph form of {Asset Name}, presented in the style of a financial analyst.

- Clearly describe the reserve composition and collateral framework.
- Assess the implications for regulatory compliance and institutional adoption.
- Highlight key strengths (such as simplicity, transparency, or stability) in plain, direct language.
- Briefly outline the main risks (custody, concentration, governance) without relying on technical jargon.
- Maintain a concise, professional, and analytical tone, avoiding promotional or marketing language.
